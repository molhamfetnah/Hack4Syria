## üåç The Crisis: A Collapsed Healthcare System  
Syria‚Äôs healthcare system is in ruins due to war, poverty, and systemic failures:  
- **57% of hospitals** are severely damaged, **37% non-functional**.  
- **40% of emergency deaths** stem from delayed diagnoses.  
- **15,000+ doctors** have fled, leaving critical shortages.  
- **70% of Syrians** lack access to basic care.  

**Bimarestan 4.0** emerges as a lifeline‚Äîtransforming emergency care through AI.
